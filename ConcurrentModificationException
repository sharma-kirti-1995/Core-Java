To know whether the collection is structurally modified or not, fail-fast iterators use an internal flag called modCount which is updated each time a 
collection is modified. Fail-fast iterators checks the modCount flag whenever it gets the next value (i.e. using next() method), and if
it finds that the modCount has been modified after this iterator has been created, it throws ConcurrentModificationException.

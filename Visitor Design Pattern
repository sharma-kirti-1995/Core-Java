is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects. With the help of visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic
from the objects to another class. For example, think of a Shopping cart where we can add different type of items (Elements).
Primary goal of the visitor pattern is to moves the operational logic from the objects to another class.Using visitor patterns, we can achieve the open-close principle

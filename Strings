Immutable class- Immutable class is a class which once created, it's content can not be changed. Immutable classes are good choice for HashMap key as their state 
cannot be changed once they are created. Objects of immuable classes are also thread safe as threads can not change the value of its fields once it is created.

Ways to prevent Mutablility ->
1) Dont allow setters in the Address class -> But we dont have access to Address class
2) Make Child class of Address with setters throwing exception and use that Child class in the main calling code -> Not useful if we have multiple Mutable classes
   in the Address class itself.
3) Return clone of object of Address.
Customized Immutable String

class MyImmutableString {
final private String name;
final private int id;
final private Address address;
// No setters

public void getName() { return name; }
public void getID() { return id; }
public void getAddress() { return address);
//Instead of returning Address, we need to return the clone of address i.e.
public void getAddress() { return address.clone(); }  // Cloneable Interface should be implemented, this will not affect the mt1 object below.
public MyImmutableString() { }

}

class MainDemo {
MyImmutableString mt1 = new MyImmutableString(1,"Kirti", new Address(101,"Ghaziabad"));
Address address = mt1.getAddress();
address.setStreet(200);
address.setCity("Delhi");

SOP(mt1); // Address changed, String is no longer mutable. To overcome this, we need to 



}

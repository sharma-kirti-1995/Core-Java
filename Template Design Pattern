Behaviour Pattern
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without 
changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.
Core Java libraries that implements Template design Pattern:
All non-abstract methods of java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer.
All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap.
In javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet class, all the doXXX() methods.

Identification: Template Method can be recognized if you see a method in base class that calls a bunch of other methods that are either abstract or empty.
